I am writing to you from a brigth spaceship in a confident galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a blue rocket in August. There are 23 crew members and experts of spaceships here! In the
laboratory there is a pool full of hydrochloric acid. I fall asleep each night on a cosmic bed of
titanium and dream of throwball wistfully. It feels as though I have lived here for
four [17]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
[18] on a [19] [20]!!


Best wishes,
