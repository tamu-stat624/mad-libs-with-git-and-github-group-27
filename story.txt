Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Aman,

I am writing to you from a spectacular  spaceship in a vast  galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a pink rocket in September. There are 5 galaxies and cluster of stars here! In the
51 there is a pool full of nitrogen. I fall asleep each night on a cosmic bed of
titanium and dream of throwball wistfully. It feels as though I have lived here for
eighty years. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
space travel on a magnificient space rocket!!

Best wishes,
Prachi
